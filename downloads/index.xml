      <description>Platform Specific Instructions for Official Binaries All official Julia binaries produce portable installations. Once installed, the directory in which Julia was installed can be moved to a different location on the same computer, or even to a different computer.
Windows Julia is available for Windows 7 and later, both 32 bit and 64 bit.
 Download the Windows julia.exe installer for your platform. 32-bit julia works on both x86 and x86_64.</description>
