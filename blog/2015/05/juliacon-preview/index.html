<p>The <a href="https://juliacon.org/2014/">first ever JuliaCon</a> was held in Chicago last year and was a great success. JuliaCon is back for 2015, this time in Cambridge, Massachusetts at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>&rsquo;s architecturally-delightful Stata Center, the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">home of computer science at MIT</a>. Last year we had a single-track format, but this year we&rsquo;ve expanded into a four-day extravaganza:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Wednesday 24th there will an introduction to Julia workshop run by <a href="https://github.com/dpsanders">David P. Sanders (@dpsanders)</a> as well as a Julia <strong>hackathon</strong> - a great chance to get some help for your new Julia projects, or to begin contributing to Julia or its many packages.</li>
<li>On Thursday 25th and Friday 26th we will be having speakers talking about a range of topics - we were fortunate to have so many fantastic submissions that we had to open up a second track of talks. The near-final <a href="https://juliacon.org">schedule is on the main page</a>. We&rsquo;ll be alternating between ~40 minute long &ldquo;regular&rdquo; talks, and ~10 minute long &ldquo;lightning&rdquo; talks across all the sessions.</li>
<li>On Saturday 27th we will finish with a series of <strong>workshops</strong> on a range of topics: data wrangling and visualization, <a href="https://juliaopt.org">optimization</a>, high-performance computing and more. These workshops run from 1.5 to 3 hours and will be a great way to rapidly boost your Julia skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>After getting everyone settled in, we&rsquo;ll start the conference proper with a session about the use of Julia in a wide variety of <strong>scientific applications</strong>. Many of the talks at the conference focus on Julia package organizations: groupings of similar packages that promote interoperability and focussing of efforts. In the session <a href="https://github.com/dcjones">Daniel C. Jones (@dcjones)</a>, the creator of the visualization package <a href="https://gadflyjl.org">Gadfly</a>, will discuss the advances being made in the <a href="https://github.com/BioJulia">BioJulia</a> <strong>bioinformatics</strong> organization, and <a href="https://github.com/kbarbary">Kyle Barbary (@kbarbary)</a> will present <a href="https://juliaastro.github.io/">JuliaAstro</a>, a home for <strong>astronomy and astrophysics</strong> packages. Theres something for everyone: quantitative <strong>economic modeling</strong> (<a href="https://quantecon.org/">QuantEcon.jl</a>), <strong>quantum statistical simulations</strong>, and how to fit Julia into a pre-existing body of code in other languages.</p>

<p>After lunch we&rsquo;ll be splitting into two tracks: <strong>visualization and interactivity</strong> and <strong>statistics</strong>. The <strong>visualization</strong> track will be demonstrating some of the exciting advances being made that enable Julia to both produce high-quality visualizations, but also share them. <a href="https://github.com/MikeInnes">Mike Innes (@one-more-minute)</a>, creator of the <strong><a href="https://junolab.org/">Juno</a> IDE for Julia</strong>, will be sharing his working on building <strong>web-powered apps</strong> in Julia, while <a href="https://github.com/ViralBShah">Viral B. Shah (@ViralBShah)</a>, one of the Julia founders, will be discussing more about the inner workings of and plans for <strong><a href="https://juliabox.com">JuliaBox</a></strong>. For a different take on &ldquo;visualization&rdquo;, <a href="https://github.com/jminardi">Jack Minardi of Voxel8</a> will be sharing how Julia is powering their <strong>3D printing work</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>statistics</strong> session covers some hot topics in the field, including two talks from researchers at MIT about how Julia is playing a big part: <strong>probabilistic programming</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/zenna/Sigma.jl">Sigma.jl</a>) and <strong>deep learning</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/pluskid/Mocha.jl">Mocha.jl</a>). Facebooker John Myles White, author of <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do">&ldquo;Machine Learning for Hackers&rdquo;</a> and a variety of packages in R and Julia, will share his thoughts on how statistics in Julia can be taken to the next stage in development, and <a href="https://github.com/ninjin">Pontus Stenetop (@ninjin)</a> will educate and entertain in his talk &ldquo;Suitably Naming a Child with Multiple Nationalities using Julia&rdquo;.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll come together at the end of Thursday to learn more about how to write <a href="https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl">good</a> Julia code, how to write packages that Just Work on Windows, and how wrappers around C libraries can be made easier than you might think through the magic of <a href="https://github.com/ihnorton/Clang.jl">Clang.jl</a>. <a href="https://github.com/IainNZ">Iain Dunning (@IainNZ)</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://pkg.julialang.org">Julia&rsquo;s package listing and test infrastructure</a> will follow up on last years talk by giving a brief history and updated status report on Julia&rsquo;s package ecosystem. Finally current Googler <a href="https://github.com/astrieanna">Lean Hanson (@astrieanna)</a> will share some of her tips for people looking to get started with contributing to Julia and to open-source projects.</p>

<p>Whatever you get up to after the talks end on Thursday, make sure you are up in time for&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="friday-s-talks">Friday&rsquo;s talks</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.juliaopt.org/images/juliaopt.svg" width="20%"></p>

<p>If you are interested in learning <strong>how Julia works</strong> from the people who work on it every day, then Friday morning&rsquo;s session is for you. The morning will kick off with newly-minted-PhD and Julia co-founder <a href="https://github.com/JeffBezanson">Jeff Bezanson (@JeffBezanson)</a>, who is still recovering from his defense and will be updating us on the title of his talk soon. We&rsquo;ll be learning more about different stages of the <strong>compilation process</strong> from contributors <a href="https://github.com/jakebolewski">Jake Bolewski (@jakebolewski)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quinnj">Jacob Quinn (@quinnj)</a>, and we&rsquo;ll be covering a miscellany of other cutting-edge topics for Julia like tuning LLVM, debugging, and interfaces.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we&rsquo;ll have four sessions split across two rooms. In the second <strong>scientific applications</strong> session we&rsquo;ll be learning more about how Julia is being used to <strong>prevent airborne collisions</strong> from Lincoln Lab&rsquo;s Robert Moss, and <a href="https://github.com/IainNZ">Iain Dunning (@IainNZ)</a> will give a sequel to last years <a href="https://juliaopt.org">JuliaOpt</a> talk to update us on how Julia is becoming the language of choice for many for <strong>optimization</strong>. We&rsquo;ll also hear how Julia is enabling rapid development of advanced algorithms for simulating <strong>quantum systems</strong>, evolving graphs, and analyzing <strong>seismic waves</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>numerical computing</strong> track kicks of with Stanford&rsquo;s Prof. <a href="https://github.com/poulson">Jack Poulson (@poulson)</a>, creator of the <a href="https://github.com/elemental/Elemental">Elemental</a> library for <strong>distributed-memory linear algebra</strong>. Right after, the linear algebra wizard <a href="https://github.com/xianyi">Zhang Xianyi (@xianyi)</a> will give a talk about <a href="https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS">OpenBLAS</a>, the high-performance linear algebra library Julia ships with. After a break, we&rsquo;ll hear Viral&rsquo;s thoughts on how <strong>sparse matrices</strong> currently and should work in Julia, before finishing off with lightning talks about <strong>validated numerics</strong> and <strong>Taylor series</strong>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see out the day with two sessions that hit some topics of interest to people deploying Julia into larger systems: <strong>data</strong> and <strong>parallel computing</strong>. In the data session we&rsquo;ll learn how about the nuts and bolts of <strong>sharing and storing data</strong> in Julia and hear more about plans for the future by the contributors working in these areas. Make sure to check out the talk by <a href="https://github.com/aviks">Avik Sengupta (@aviks)</a> about his real-world industry experiences about putting Julia code behind a <strong>web-accessible API</strong>.</p>

<p>The parallel computing session will tackle parallelism at all levels. Contributor <a href="https://github.com/amitmurthy/">Amit Murthy (@amitmurthy)</a> will open the session with a discussion of his recent work and plans for managing Julia in a cluster. We&rsquo;ll also hear about work being done to <strong>make Julia multithreaded</strong> at Intel, and about running Julia on a <strong>Cray supercomputer</strong>.</p>

<p>After all that you will surely be inspired to hack on Julia projects all night, but make sure to wake up for a full day of <strong>workshops</strong> on Saturday!</p>

<p>Remember to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/juliacon-2015-tickets-16517619645">get your tickets</a> and <a href="https://juliacon.org/#accom">book your hotel</a> before June 4th to take advantage of early bird pricing. We&rsquo;d also like to thank our <strong>platinum sponsors</strong>: the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, BlackRock, and Julia Computing. We can&rsquo;t forget out <strong>silver sponsors</strong> either: Intel and Invenia. We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
